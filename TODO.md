# Blockers

* Switch to release build
  * Find out whether `skbuild` has a special mechanism to do it or just put `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` into the `CMAKE_ARGS`.
* Enable other platforms
  * non-x86 linux
  * Windows
  * MacOS

# Minor stuff

* Make the two other scripts available that mgevaert ships
* Add full metadata to setup.py
* Write README.md and include it in PyPI
* Write a piece of documentation what needs to be done to add a version

# Testing

* Try to build from sdist
